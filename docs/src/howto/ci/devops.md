# Azure DevOps support

!!! warning "Azure DevOps documentation is no longer maintained"

    While it is perfectly possible to implement MACH composer in an Azure DevOps pipeline, we will not be updating its documentation anymore, as Azure DevOps seems to be on its way out. We will be focusing on GitHub Actions instead.

    For a current implementation of a GitHub CI/CD flow, please see the [Github CI/CD documentation of MACH composer](./github.md).

For the old, outdated Azure devops documentation, [click here](./devops_old.md).
