# Gitlab CI/CD support

!!! warning "Gitlab CI/CD documentation is no longer maintained"

    While it is perfectly possible to implement MACH composer in a Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, we will not be updating its documentation anymore, as Github Actions seems to be the preferred CI/CD solution for most of our users.

    For a current implementation of a GitHub CI/CD flow, please see the [Github CI/CD documentation of MACH composer](./github.md).

For the old, outdated Gitlab CI/CD documentation, [click here](./gitlab_old.md).
