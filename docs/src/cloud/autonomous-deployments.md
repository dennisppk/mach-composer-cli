# Autonomous component deployments

We want to provide the ability for components to deploy themselves independently of other components, through their own CI/CD
pipelines. This will allow teams to operate more independently of other teams, while still building within a larger
composable architecture.

!!! info "In design phase"

    This feature is currently being designed, so consider this page our current thinking around the implementation.

## How would it work?

Each component is in fact a Terraform module that can be executed individually when provided with the required input
parameters. Our current thinking is that MACH composer ☁️ will provide all input parameters (Terraform variables) for each of
the sites that this component needs to be deployed to. And after the deployment is done, the output parameters will be stored
in MACH composer ☁️ again.
