# Azure

This plugin provides integration with Microsoft Azure.

!!! note "This is the new `azure-minimal` plugin"
    The `azure-minimal` plugin is the new version of the `azure` plugin. The `azure` plugin has been deprecated, as it is too opinionated and does not allow for enough flexibility. The `azure-minimal` plugin is a more minimalistic plugin, which allows for more flexibility.
