## 2.5.0 (2022-12-19)

This release introduces support for plugins in mach-composer. All previous
supported plugins (also called integrations) are still bundled with the
exectutable but will in the future be distributed separately.

With this release it is also possible to use build custom plugins. A plugin
should be created with the mach-composer-plugin-sdk and the resulting executable
should be available on your $PATH as `mach-composer-plugin-<plugin>`

Other changes include:
  - New `schema` subcommand which outputs a json schema based on the given
    config file (to know which plugins to use).
  - Improved error and warning output (inspired by Terraform)
  - Improved variable handling, only allow SOPS for encrypted variables when the
    variables are used.
  - Fix issue with parsing aws_account_id by required it to be a string, fixes
    invalid yaml guessing when the account_id starts with a zero.
