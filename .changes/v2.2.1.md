## 2.2.1 (2022-06-10)

- Fixed inconsistencies between 1.2 and 2.x:
  - Add `branch` option to component definitions to be able to perform a
    `mach-composer update` and stay within a certain branch (during development)
  - Fixed commercetools `stores` definitions
  - Fixed bug where custom AWS and Azure provider version definitions weren't picked up
