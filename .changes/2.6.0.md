## 2.6.0 (2023-01-20)

 - Add optional support to automatically download MACH composer plugins when
   defined in the config file. For example::

    ```yaml
    mach_composer:
      version: 1
      plugins:
        aws:
          source: mach-composer/aws
          version: 0.1.0
        sentry:
          source: mach-composer/sentry
          version: 0.1.2
    ```

   Will download the plugins to your local plugin directory if these are not
   found.
