## 2.5.3 (2023-01-12)

 - Print a deprecation warning when using `mach-composer init`. This command is
   replaced by `mach-composer terraform init`.
 - Generate a mach-composer lock file in the output directory to optimize
   rebuilds and prevent unnecessary terraform actions.
 - Add a new command `mach-composer show-plan` which shows the generated plans
   by terraform.
