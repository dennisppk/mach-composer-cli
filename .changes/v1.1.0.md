### Upgrade notes

**For Azure**

- Each component that has an `endpoint` defined needs to have an Terraform output defined for that endpoint. For example:<br>
  ```terraform
  output "azure_endpoint_main" {
    value = {
      address = azurerm_function_app.main.default_hostname
    }
  }
  ```
  Read more about the [configuration options](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#defining-outputs).
- Remove endpoints restrictions: Azure components can now use multiple endpoints.
- Changes have been made in the Frontdoor configuration in the underlying Terraform Azure provider.<br>
  If you are using endpoints with a custom domain, you'll need to import the new [`azurerm_frontdoor_custom_https_configuration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/frontdoor_custom_https_configuration#import) into your Terraform state.<br>
  More on how to work with the Terraform state in [our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.machcomposer.io/topics/development/troubleshooting.html).
