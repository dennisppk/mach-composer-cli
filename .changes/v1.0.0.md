### Breaking changes

**Generic**

- **config**: Rename `general_config` to `global`
- **config**: `base_url` has been replaced by the `endpoints` settings:<br>
  ```yaml
  sites:
  - identifier: mach-site-eu
    base_url: https://api.eu-tst.mach-example.net
  ```
  becomes
  ```yaml
  sites:
  - identifier: mach-site-eu
    endpoints:
      main: https://api.eu-tst.mach-example.net
  ```
  When you name the endpoint that replaces `base_url` "main", it will have
  the least effect on your existing Terraform state.<br><br>
  When endpoints are defined on a component, the component needs to define
  endpoint Terraform variables
  ([AWS](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/aws.html#with-endpoints)
  and
  [Azure](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#with-endpoints))
- **config**: commercetools `create_frontend_credentials` is replaced with new `frontend` block:
  ```terraform
  commercetools:
    frontend:
      create_credentials: false
  ```
  default is still `true`
- **config** Default scopes for commercetools frontend API client changed:
    - If you want to maintain previous scope set, define the following in the `frontend` block:
    ```terraform
    commercetools:
      frontend:
        permission_scopes: [manage_my_profile, manage_my_orders, view_states, manage_my_shopping_lists, view_products, manage_my_payments, create_anonymous_token, view_project_settings]
    ```
    - Old scope set didn't include store-specific [`manage_my_profile:project:store`](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes#manage_my_profileprojectkeystorekey) scope. If you're using the old set as described above, MACH will need to re-create the store-specific API clients in order to add the extra scope. For migration options, see next point
    - In case the scope needs to be updated but (production) frontend
      implementations are already using the current API client credentials, a
      way to migrate is to;
      1. Remove the old API client resource with `terraform state rm commercetools_api_client.frontend_credentials`
      2. Repeat step for the store-specific API clients in your Terraform
         state
      3. Perform `mach apply` to create the new API clients with updated
         scope
      4. Your commercetools project will now contain API clients with the
         same name. Once the frontend implementation is migrated, the older one
         can safely be removed.
- **component**: Components with a `commercetools` integration require a new variable `ct_stores`:
  ```terraform
  variable "ct_stores" {
    type = map(object({
      key       = string
      variables = any
      secrets   = any
    }))
    default = {}
  }
  ```
- **component**: The folowing deprecated values in the `var.variables` are removed:
  ```terraform
  var.variables["CT_PROJECT_KEY"]
  var.variables["CT_API_URL"]
  var.variables["CT_AUTH_URL"]
  ```
  See [0.5.0 release notes](#050-2020-11-09)
- **component**: The `var.environment_variables` won't be set by MACH anymore. Use `var.variables` for this


**AWS**

- **config**: The AWS `route53_zone_name` setting has been removed in favour of multiple endpoint support
- **config**: The `deploy_role` setting has been renamed to `deploy_role_name`
- **component**: Introduced new variable `tags`:
  ```terraform
  variable "tags" {
    type        = map(string)
    description = "Tags to be used on resources."
  }
  ```
- **component**: Add `aws_endpoint_*` variable when the `endpoints` configuration option is used. [More information](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/aws.html#with-endpoints) on defining and using endpoints in AWS.

**Azure**

- **config**: The `front_door` configuration block has been renamed to `frontdoor`
- **config**: The Azure frontdoor settings `dns_zone` and `ssl_key_*` settings have been removed;<br>
  Certificates are now managed by Frontdoor and dns_zone is auto-detected.
- **config**: The Azure frontdoor settings `resource_group` has been renamed to `dns_resource_group`
- **config**: Moved component `short_name` to new `azure` configuration block
- **state**: The Terraform `azurerm_dns_cname_record` resources have been renamed; they now take the name of the associated endpoint key. For the smoothest transition, rename them in your Terraform state:<br>
  ```bash
  terraform state mv azurerm_dns_cname_record.<project-key> azurerm_dns_cname_record.<endpoint-key>
  ```
- **component**: Prefixed **all** Azure-specific variables with `azure_`
- **component**: The `FRONTDOOR_ID` value is removed from the `var.variables`
  of a component. Replaced with `var.azure_endpoint_*`. [More
  information](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#with-endpoints)
  on defining and using endpoints in Azure.
- **component**: `app_service_plan_id` has been replaced with
  `azure_app_service_plan` containing both an `id` and `name` so the
  [azurerm_app_service_plan](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/app_service_plan)
  data source can be used in a component.<br>

  It will *only be set* when `service_plan` is configured in the component
  [definition](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/syntax/components.html#azure)
  or [site configuration](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/syntax/sites.html#azure_1)
  ```terraform
  variable "azure_app_service_plan" {
    type = object({
      id                  = string
      name                = string
      resource_group_name = string
    })
  }
  ```
- **component**: Replaced `resource_group_name` and `resource_group_location` with `azure_resource_group`:
  ```terraform
  variable "azure_resource_group" {
    type = object({
      name     = string
      location = string
    })
  }
  ```
