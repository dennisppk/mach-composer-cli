## 2.0.0 (2022-04-05)

Rewrite of the Python codebase to Go. Goal is to make it easier to distribute
mach-composer in a cross-platform way.

A number of features which were minimal used are removed.
  - The `mach bootstrap` command is no longer present. It was a simple wrapper
    around Python cookiecutter. This can still be used separately
  - The `mach sites` and `mach components` commands since they were unused.
  - The `--with-sp-login` is removed. This flags used to run `az login`. If this
    is needed it needs to be run before mach-composer is run.
  - The `--ignore-version` flag is removed. The version in the config file now
    indicates a schema version. Only version 1 is supported and updates within
    this schema version should always be backwards compatible.
